added rule block in inbound on a specific port, 
tested locally,
A firewall filters traffic by checking every incoming and outgoing data packet and deciding whether to allow or block it based on a set of rules. 
It compares the packet’s source, destination, port, and protocol with its rule-set, and if the packet matches an allowed rule, it passes through, if not, it gets blocked.
This protects the network from unauthorized access, malware, and suspicious activity.
